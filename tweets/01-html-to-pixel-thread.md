From HTML to Pixel: The Complete Journey üöÄ

#WebDev #Frontend #BrowserRendering | 2025-01-15 | Draft |
| 2 | 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Parsing HTML ‚Üí DOM**

When browser gets HTML, it parses top to bottom, building a tree-like structure called DOM (Document Object Model).

Each HTML element becomes a node in this tree, creating a hierarchy the browser can traverse.

| 3 | 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Parsing CSS ‚Üí CSSOM**

Meanwhile, browser loads & parses CSS, building CSSOM (CSS Object Model).

This maps how styles apply to DOM elements, computing final values for each property.

CSSOM organizes rules by selector, not by DOM structure!

| 4 | 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Construct Render Tree**

Browser combines DOM + CSSOM into Render Tree.

Key insight: Only visual elements included! Hidden elements (display: none) are excluded.

This tree has computed styles attached to each element.

| 5 | 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Layout (Reflow)**

Browser traverses Render Tree to compute geometry:
‚Ä¢ How big is each box?
‚Ä¢ Where does each box go?

Outputs exact coordinates for each visible node.

This is where the magic of positioning happens! üìê

#Layout #Reflow #BrowserRendering | 2025-01-15 | Draft |
| 6 | 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Painting**

Browser goes through layout info and paints each box:
‚Ä¢ Fills backgrounds
‚Ä¢ Draws text
‚Ä¢ Draws borders, shadows, images

This happens in layers for efficiency.

| 7 | 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Compositing**

Modern browsers break page into layers for efficient rendering.

GPU composites these layers:
‚Ä¢ Puts them together in correct stacking order
‚Ä¢ Applies transformations (opacity, transform)

| 8 | 7Ô∏è‚É£ **Rasterization ‚Üí Pixels**

Browser rasterizes layers into bitmaps.

GPU converts vector graphics & text into actual pixel data.

Finally, pixels sent to screen's framebuffer.

From code to pixels! üéØ

| 9 | **What happens when you interact?**

‚Ä¢ Scrolling: Only compositing repeats (GPU moves layers)
‚Ä¢ Hovering: Paint + composite repeat (new colors)
‚Ä¢ JS changes: May trigger layout + paint + composite

Performance depends on what you change! ‚ö°

| 10 | **Key Performance Bottlenecks:**

‚Ä¢ Layout/reflow: Expensive if many nodes shift
‚Ä¢ Paint: Expensive for complex visuals
‚Ä¢ Compositing: GPU-friendly but too many layers costly

Optimize based on what you're changing! üéØ

| 11 | **Rendering Pipeline Summary:**

HTML ‚Üí DOM
CSS ‚Üí CSSOM
DOM + CSSOM ‚Üí Render Tree
Render Tree ‚Üí Layout (geometry)
Layout ‚Üí Paint (layers)
Layers ‚Üí Composite (final image)

Each step builds on the previous! üîÑ

| 12 | üéØ **Key Takeaway:**

Browser rendering is a 7-step pipeline from HTML to pixels. Understanding this helps you:

‚Ä¢ Write more performant code
‚Ä¢ Debug rendering issues
‚Ä¢ Optimize for specific interactions

The journey from code to pixels is fascinating! ‚ú®
