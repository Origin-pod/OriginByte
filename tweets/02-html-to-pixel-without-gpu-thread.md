| 1       | 🧵 What about the time BEFORE GPUs? How did browsers render when everything had to be done on CPU? |

Let's explore the CPU-only rendering era (1990s-2000s)!

From HTML to Pixel without GPU 🖥️

#WebDev #BrowserRendering #History | 2025-01-16 | Draft |
| 2 | **The Fundamental Difference:**

**GPU Era (Modern):**
• 1000s of cores
• Specialized graphics hardware
• High bandwidth memory
• Command-based rendering

**CPU Era (1990s):**
• 4-32 cores typical
• General purpose hardware
• Shared system memory
• Sequential operations

| 3 | **CPU-Only Rendering Pipeline:**

1. Parse HTML → DOM ✅
2. Parse CSS → CSSOM ✅
3. Construct Render Tree ✅
4. Layout (Reflow) ✅
5. **Painting (CPU-Based)** 🔥
6. Direct to Screen

The painting step was completely different!

| 4 | **CPU Painting Process:**

Instead of GPU layers, CPU painted everything to a SINGLE bitmap:

```
Single Bitmap Buffer
├── Paint background
├── Paint header background
├── Paint header text
├── Paint content background
├── Paint content text
└── Paint borders, shadows
```

No layers, no compositing! 📊

| 5 | **Key Differences (CPU vs GPU):**

**CPU-Only:**
• No Layers: Everything to single bitmap
• No GPU: All rendering on CPU
• Sequential Painting: One after another
• No Compositing: Direct to screen

**GPU-Accelerated:**
• Multiple layers
• GPU rendering
• Parallel processing
• Layer compositing

#CPURendering #GPURendering #Comparison | 2025-01-16 | Draft |
| 6 | **Performance Comparison:**

**CPU-Only (1990s-2000s):**
• FPS: 15-30
• CPU Usage: 80-100%
• Memory: Large bitmaps in system RAM
• Animations: Choppy, stuttering

**GPU-Accelerated (Modern):**
• FPS: 60+
• CPU Usage: 10-20%
• Memory: Efficient GPU memory
• Animations: Smooth, fluid

#Performance #Comparison #BrowserRendering | 2025-01-16 | Draft |
| 7 | **Real-World Example:**

**CPU-Only Approach:**

```html
<div class="header">Hello World</div>
<div class="content">Welcome!</div>
```

**Rendering Steps:**

1. Parse HTML → DOM
2. Parse CSS → CSSOM
3. Create Render Tree
4. Calculate Layout
5. **CPU Painting (Sequential)**
6. Send bitmap to screen

#CPURendering #Example #WebDev | 2025-01-16 | Draft |
| 8 | **Performance Metrics (CPU-Only):**

• Time: ~50-100ms per frame
• FPS: 10-20 FPS typical
• Memory: Large bitmap in system RAM
• CPU Usage: 80-100% during rendering

Compare to modern 16ms per frame (60 FPS)! 🐌

| 9 | **Historical Browser Examples:**

**Netscape Navigator (1994-2007):**
• CPU-only software rendering
• 15-30 FPS typical
• Large bitmaps in system RAM
• Limited, choppy animations

**Internet Explorer 6 (2001-2006):**
• CPU-based with some hardware acceleration
• 20-40 FPS
• Basic, often stuttering animations

#History #Browsers #CPURendering | 2025-01-16 | Draft |
| 10 | **Modern Chrome/Firefox (2010+):**
• Full GPU acceleration
• 60 FPS smooth
• GPU memory for layers
• Smooth, hardware-accelerated animations

The evolution is incredible! 🚀

| 11 | **Why the Shift to GPU?**

1. **Performance Demands:**
   • Web apps became more complex
   • Animations & transitions common
   • Users expected smooth 60 FPS

2. **Hardware Evolution:**
   • GPUs became standard
   • GPU memory faster & larger
   • GPU drivers more stable

| 12 | **3. Software Innovation:**
• WebGL enabled GPU programming
• CSS transforms & animations
• Canvas & WebGL APIs

The web evolved from simple documents to complex applications! 💻

| 13 | **Legacy Impact:**

The CPU-only era still influences modern web development:

• **Progressive Enhancement:** Sites work without GPU
• **Performance Best Practices:** Minimize layout thrashing
• **Mobile Considerations:** Battery life, thermal throttling

History shapes the present! 📚

#Legacy #WebDev #Performance | 2025-01-16 | Draft |
| 14 | **Modern Hybrid Approach:**

Today's browsers use both CPU & GPU:

```
CPU Tasks:
├── HTML/CSS Parsing
├── JavaScript Execution
└── Layout Calculations

GPU Tasks:
├── Layer Creation
├── Painting
├── Compositing
└── Rasterization
```

Best of both worlds! 🌟

| 15 | **Key Takeaways:**

1. **CPU-Only Rendering** was simpler but much slower
2. **GPU Acceleration** enabled smooth 60 FPS experiences
3. **Modern browsers** use hybrid CPU/GPU approach
4. **Performance expectations** evolved dramatically
5. **Legacy considerations** still matter

The journey from CPU to GPU is fascinating! 🎯
