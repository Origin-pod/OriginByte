## 📄 Abstract
This paper introduces **CodeGRAG**, an efficient, tuning-free framework that enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) in single-round and cross-lingual code generation by injecting structured external knowledge. The core innovation combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a novel, composite code representation.

## 💡 Core Problem and Solution

### Problem

General LLMs treat code as a sequence of tokens, ignoring its inherent logical and structural complexity (the _syntactic gap_). This results in missed semantic cues, reduced code quality, and difficulty transferring knowledge across different programming languages (the _cross-lingual challenge_). Existing methods that rely on multi-prompt solutions are computationally expensive.

### Solution: CodeGRAG (Syntax Graph RAG)

CodeGRAG addresses this by extracting a structured representation of code blocks—the **Composed Syntax Graph**—and retrieving the most relevant graph from a knowledge base to augment the LLM's prompt. This allows the LLM to access structural knowledge without full model fine-tuning.

## 🏗️ The Methodology

The framework operates in three stages:

1.  **Syntax Knowledge Base Preparation**:

    - Code blocks in the retrieval pool are converted into a **Composed Syntax Graph**.
    - This graph combines the **Data Flow Graph (DFG)** (semantic dependencies) and the **Control Flow Graph (CFG)** (logical execution order), both built upon the **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**, plus read-write signals. This combined view provides a purified, high-level representation of the code's inherent logic.

2.  **Knowledge Querying**:

    - A query is created by concatenating the problem description and the function declaration of the target task.
    - A retrieval function then finds the most relevant graph from the knowledge base. This function uses:
      - A pre-trained text/code encoder (like _CodeT5+_ or _UniXcoder_) for the natural language query and raw code.
      - A designed **Graph Neural Network (GNN)** to encode the graphical views.
    - **Contrastive learning** is used to align the query, raw code, and the graph embeddings (Question-Answer and Code-Graph alignment).

3.  **Knowledge Augmented Generation**:
    - The retrieved Composed Syntax Graph is formatted and prepended into the LLM's prompt as external knowledge alongside the original problem statement.
    - The LLM (e.g., _GPT-3.5-Turbo_) generates the final code using this augmented context, requiring only a single call.

## 📈 Key Results

Experiments on the **HumanEval-X** multi-lingual benchmark showed significant performance gains (measured by `Pass@1`):

- **Performance Gain (RQ1 & RQ2)**: Using the CodeGRAG method consistently outperforms the base LLM and models augmented with only raw code blocks (Code-RAG).

  - _Example (C++)_: GPT-3.5-Turbo base (57.93) -> **CodeGRAG (62.20)**
  - _Example (Python)_: Code-RAG (72.56) -> **CodeGRAG (77.44)** (cross-lingual)

- **Cross-Lingual Augmentation (RQ3)**: CodeGRAG enables cross-lingual enhancement, notably improving Python generation when retrieving C++ graphs. This confirms that the Composed Syntax Graph abstracts high-level logic that is shared across different programming languages.

  - _Example (Python with cross-lingual C++ graph retrieval)_: GPT-3.5-Turbo base (71.95) -> **CodeGRAG (77.44)**.

- **Structural Components (RQ5)**: Ablation studies showed that **edge features** (flow types) matter the most for the model's structural understanding, followed by the topological structure.

## 🎯 Conclusion

CodeGRAG successfully validates the principle that structured, graph-based knowledge is highly effective for improving code LLMs. By designing an efficient RAG system around a novel **Composed Syntax Graph**, the authors provide a tuning-free method that enhances code quality, fluency, and cross-lingual knowledge transfer.
