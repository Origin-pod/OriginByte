1. Closed Universe : A closed universe is a hypothetical universe where there is no edge or boundary. In other words, it is a universe that is completely enclosed and does not have any endpoint or horizon. It is often referred to as a "closed" universe as it is closed off from any further expansion or expansion into a "nothingness". This concept is often used in theoretical physics to describe our universe.

2. Hilbert Space :
   A Hilbert space is a mathematical space that is used to describe the state space of a quantum system. It is a vector space that is complete with respect to a norm, and it is often used in quantum mechanics to describe the state space of a quantum system.

3. Quantum Extremal Surfaces (QES) :
   Quantum Extremal Surfaces (QES) are a concept in quantum gravity that refers to the boundary of a quantum system. They are used to describe the geometry of a quantum system and are often used in the study of black holes and other quantum systems.

4. Gravitational Path Integral:  
   The gravitational path integral is a method used in quantum gravity to calculate the probability amplitude for a system to transition from one state to another. It is a sum over all possible paths that the system can take, weighted by their probability amplitudes.

5. Entanglement Wedge:
   The entanglement wedge is a concept in quantum gravity that refers to the region of space-time that is entangled with a closed universe. It is used to describe the geometry of a quantum system and are often used in the study of black holes and other quantum systems.

6. Gram Matrix:
   The Gram matrix is a matrix that is used to describe the geometry of a quantum system. It is a square matrix that is used to describe the geometry of a quantum system and are often used in the study of black holes and other quantum systems.

7.Holographic Duals:
Holographic duals are a concept in quantum gravity that refers to the relationship between a quantum system and its dual description in a higher-dimensional space. They are used to describe the geometry of a quantum system and are often used in the study of black holes and other quantum systems.
