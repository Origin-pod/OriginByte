- Understanding reactivity and state mechanisms
- Advanced state management patterns
- Data caching strategies

## 2. Code Exploration and Architecture

### Diff

- Systematic approach to reverse engineering complex codebases
- Understanding architectural patterns through the lens of system design principles
- Advanced techniques for code analysis using AST (Abstract Syntax Trees)
- Real-world case studies of successful and failed architectural decisions
- Performance implications of different architectural choices

### Segment

- Teams focused on Core Web Vitals optimization

### Critical Rendering Path

- HTML → CSSOM → Render Tree → Layout → Paint

### Code Splitting Strategies

- Dynamic imports
- Route-level vs. component-level splitting
- Vendor chunking

### Asset Loading Optimization

- Lazy loading for:
  - Components
  - Images
  - Fonts
  - Third-party libraries
- Resource hints:
  - Prefetching
  - Preloading
  - Prerendering

## 4. WebAssembly & Non-JavaScript Runtimes

### Diff

- Advanced memory management in WebAssembly
- Cross-language debugging techniques
- Performance optimization at the assembly level
- Security considerations in WebAssembly applications
- Advanced interop patterns between JS and WebAssembly

### Segment

### Key Considerations

- When to choose WebAssembly vs. pure JS:
  - CPU-intensive tasks
  - Existing native libraries
  - Cross-platform logic sharing

### Tooling

- wasm-bindgen
- AssemblyScript
- Emscripten

### Technical Aspects

- Interop overhead
- Data marshaling between JS and WASM
- Performance characteristics

### Future of UI Frameworks

- WASM-based frameworks (Yew, Dioxus)
- JavaScript-based frameworks
