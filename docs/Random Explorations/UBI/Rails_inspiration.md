# Key Components of a Rails-like Framework in Rust

To mirror Rails for backend APIs, we need to focus on the core features that make Rails effective for this use case:

## ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)

- Rails uses ActiveRecord to provide an intuitive, object-oriented interface to the database.
- In Rust, we can use **Diesel**, a popular ORM, to handle database interactions, migrations, and schema management.

## Routing

- Rails' routing system is declarative and expressive.
- We'll create a macro-based routing system in Rust that feels similar, with compile-time safety.

## Controllers

- Rails organizes request handling in controllers with actions.
- In Rust, we'll define a controller structure to group request handlers logically.

## Directory Structure

- A familiar layout (e.g., `app/controllers`, `app/models`, `config`) will help Rails developers transition easily.

## CLI Tools

- Rails' generators (e.g., `rails generate model`) speed up development.
- We'll build a command-line tool using **Clap** to replicate this.

## Async Performance

- Unlike Rails' traditionally synchronous nature, we'll use Rust's `async/await` for high-performance I/O-bound API workloads.

## Serialization

- For APIs, we'll use **Serde** to handle JSON serialization, skipping Rails' view layer (e.g., ERB) since we're focusing on APIs.

## Conventions and Safety

- We'll adopt Rails' convention-over-configuration philosophy while leveraging Rust's type system for additional safety.
