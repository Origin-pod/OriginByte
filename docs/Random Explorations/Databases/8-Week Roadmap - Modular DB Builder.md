## Roadmap Overview

```
Week 1-2: Foundation (Canvas + 3 Blocks)
Week 3-4: Execution (Workload + Metrics)
Week 5-6: Breadth (12 More Blocks + Comparison)
Week 7-8: Polish (UX + User Testing)
```

---

## Week 1-2: Foundation
**Goal**: Users can place blocks on a canvas and connect them

### Week 1: Canvas Infrastructure

#### Monday - Wednesday
**Task**: Set up project + visual canvas
**Deliverables**:
- [ ] React + TypeScript project scaffolding
- [ ] React Flow integration
- [ ] Basic canvas (drag, drop, pan, zoom)
- [ ] Block palette (sidebar with 3 placeholder blocks)

**Technical Details**:

#### Thursday - Friday
**Task**: Define block system architecture
**Deliverables**:
- [ ] TypeScript interfaces for Block, Port, Connection
- [ ] Block definition schema (inputs, outputs, parameters)
- [ ] Connection validation logic (type checking)

**Code Structure**:
```typescript
// src/types/block.ts
interface Block {
  id: string;
  type: string;
  name: string;
  category: BlockCategory;
  inputs: Port[];
  outputs: Port[];
  parameters: Parameter[];
}

interface Port {
  name: string;
  type: PortType;
  dataType: DataType;
}

// src/types/connection.ts
interface Connection {
  id: string;
  source: { blockId: string; portName: string };
  target: { blockId: string; portName: string };
}
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Block definitions are type-safe
- Can validate if two ports can connect
- Error messages for invalid connections

### Week 2: First Working Blocks

#### Monday - Tuesday
**Task**: Implement 3 core blocks
**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Block 1: Schema Definition (input: none, output: table metadata)
- [ ] Block 2: Heap File Storage (input: records, output: stored records)
- [ ] Block 3: Sequential Scan (input: scan request, output: records)

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// src/blocks/storage/HeapFileStorage.ts
class HeapFileStorage implements BlockImplementation {
  private pages: Page[] = [];

  execute(inputs: BlockInputs): BlockOutputs {
    // Simple in-memory heap file simulation
    const records = inputs.records;
    const pages = this.storeRecords(records);
    return { stored_records: records, pages };
  }
}
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- User can connect Schema → Heap Storage → Sequential Scan
- Data flows through blocks (mock data for now)
- Console log shows data flowing

#### Wednesday - Friday
**Task**: Parameter configuration UI

- [ ] Show progress indicator

**Execution Flow**:
```
1. Validate canvas (all inputs connected)
2. Build execution graph
3. Initialize blocks (allocate buffers, trees)
4. For each operation:

- System: total_time, throughput (ops/sec)

**Implementation**:
```typescript
class MetricsCollector {
  private metrics: Map<string, Metric> = new Map();

  recordCounter(name: string, value: number): void {
    // Increment counter
  }

  recordHistogram(name: string, value: number): void {

## Resource Requirements

### Engineering

**Full-Stack Engineer** (8 weeks full-time):
- Week 1-2: Canvas + block system
- Week 3-4: Execution engine + metrics
- Week 5-6: More blocks + comparison
- Week 7-8: Polish + testing

**OR**

**Two Engineers** (4 weeks each):
- Engineer A: Frontend (canvas, UI, metrics visualization)
- Engineer B: Backend (blocks, execution engine, algorithms)

### Design

**Designer** (2-3 weeks part-time):
- Week 1: Information architecture + wireframes
- Week 3: Metrics dashboard design
- Week 6: Comparison UI design
- Week 7: Onboarding flow design

**OR**

**Full-Stack Engineer with design skills** (no separate designer needed)

---

## Tech Stack (Finalized)

### Frontend
- **React 18** + **TypeScript 5**
- **React Flow** (canvas)
- **Recharts** (metrics visualization)
- **Tailwind CSS** (styling)
- **Zustand** (state management, simpler than Redux)
- **Vite** (build tool, fast HMR)

### Simulation Engine
- **TypeScript** (all blocks implemented in TS)
- **Web Workers** (optional, for performance)

### Storage
- **IndexedDB** (persist designs locally)
- **JSON export/import** (share designs)

### Deployment
- **Vercel** or **Netlify** (static site hosting)
- **GitHub Pages** (alternative if open source)

---

## Dependencies & Risks

### Critical Path

```
Week 1-2 (Canvas + Blocks)
    ↓
Week 3-4 (Execution + Metrics)
    ↓
Week 5-6 (More Blocks + Comparison)
    ↓
Week 7-8 (Polish + Testing)
```

**Any delay in Week 1-4 cascades to entire project.**

### Top Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **Execution too slow** (>10s for 10K ops) | Use Web Workers, optimize hot paths, sample data |
| **Block algorithms are wrong** | Validate against known benchmarks (YCSB), simplify if needed |
| **Users don't understand blocks** | Pre-built templates, inline help, tutorial |
| **Scope creep** (too many blocks) | Lock scope at 15 blocks, say no to everything else |

---

## Success Metrics (8-Week Mark)

### Quantitative
- [ ] 5+ alpha testers used the tool
- [ ] 3+ created ≥2 designs and compared them
- [ ] 1+ said "this influenced my design decision"
- [ ] Median time to first working design: `<30` min
- [ ] Execution time: `<5` seconds for 10K operations

### Qualitative
- [ ] Users understand what blocks do
- [ ] Users can find the blocks they need
- [ ] Metrics are clear and actionable
- [ ] Comparison UI clearly shows winner

### Launch
- [ ] Public URL live
- [ ] Demo video published
- [ ] Launch post on HN/Twitter/Reddit
- [ ] 10+ upvotes or retweets (initial signal)

---

## Post-MVP (Week 9+)

If MVP succeeds, prioritize:

1. **Custom block SDK** — Let users create blocks
2. **More blocks** — OLAP (columnar, vectorized), distribution (sharding)
3. **Advanced workloads** — YCSB, TPC-C benchmarks
4. **Real DB export** — Generate RocksDB config, PostgreSQL schema
5. **Collaboration** — Multi-user editing (Figma-like)

---

## Daily Standups (Suggested)

**Every morning, answer**:
1. What did I ship yesterday?
2. What will I ship today?
3. What's blocking me?

**Every Friday, answer**:
1. Did we hit this week's goal?
2. What do we cut/defer if we're behind?
3. What's the plan for next week?

---

## The One Thing That Cannot Slip

**By end of Week 4**, we must have:
- Working execution engine
- Metrics dashboard
- 3 blocks that demonstrate clear performance difference

**Why**: This is the core value prop. If this doesn't work, nothing else matters.

---

**End of Roadmap**
