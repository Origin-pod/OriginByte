Create a detailed technical Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a [insert product or feature, e.g., "cloud-based task management application"]. The PRD should be structured, clear, and comprehensive, targeting a technical audience including developers, engineers, and product managers. Include the following sections:

1. **Overview**: Provide a concise summary of the product/feature, its purpose, and the problem it solves.
2. **Goals and Objectives**: List specific, measurable goals (e.g., performance, scalability, user adoption) and success metrics.
3. **Target Audience**: Define the primary users, their roles, and key use cases.
4. **Functional Requirements**: Detail core functionalities, including user flows, key features, and interactions. Use bullet points or numbered lists for clarity.
5. **Technical Requirements**: Specify technical specifications, including:
   - System architecture (e.g., tech stack, APIs, integrations).
   - Performance requirements (e.g., latency, throughput).
   - Scalability needs (e.g., expected user load).
   - Security and compliance requirements (e.g., data encryption, GDPR).
6. **Non-Functional Requirements**: Outline requirements like usability, accessibility, reliability, and maintainability.
7. **Assumptions and Constraints**: List any assumptions (e.g., user familiarity with tools) and constraints (e.g., budget, timeline, legacy systems).
8. **Dependencies**: Identify internal or external dependencies (e.g., third-party APIs, existing infrastructure).
9. **Risks and Mitigation**: Highlight potential risks (e.g., technical debt, delays) and proposed mitigation strategies.
10. **Timeline and Milestones**: Provide a high-level timeline with key milestones and deliverables.
11. **Stakeholders**: List key stakeholders (e.g., product manager, engineering lead) and their roles.
12. **Glossary**: Define technical terms or acronyms for clarity.

Use a professional tone, avoid ambiguity, and ensure the document is actionable for development teams. Include placeholders for specific details (e.g., [insert API name]) where customization is needed. Format the PRD in markdown for readability.
