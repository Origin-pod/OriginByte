# An Introduction to Residuality Theory - Barry O'Reilly - NDC London 2024

## Why is software architecture so difficult ?

TIME, CHANGE, UNCERTAINTY

- Standard architectural representations(UML, Archimate) has no way to represent
  - Time
  - Change over time
  - Uncertainity about change

## What is the unit of SWE ?

- Software
  Machine
  Punchcard
  Procedure
  Module
  Object
  Service
  Function
  Microservice
  Process
  Feature
  Pattern

None of these capture time, uncertainity or change.
This course will introduce a new unit - The residue
That has this explicit goal in mind

### Order and Disorder

- Some systems are ordered :

  - Highly constrained
  - Future states can be predicted
  - They can be tested
    Have consistent behaviour over testing cycles
    = Software is ordered

- Some systems are disordered :
  - Loose constraints
  - Unpredictable
  - Changing pattern or no pattern
  - Human and business systems are disordered
